Place the `themes` folder inside of

**Normal Version**: `Grande_Omega\resources\app\desktop\Student\wwwroot`

## Contributing

Fork this repo and clone it to your workspace.

Create your own skin by making a folder for your skin in the skins folder.
I recommed to use Fox Dark as a starting point.

Add screenshots of your theme to this ReadMe file.

Create a pull request on this repo with a branch sharing the name of your theme.
Once your theme has been approved it will be merged into the master branch.

If you haven't already setup signed commits, these look nicer :)

Any skins that **edit any non CSS (except index.html and main.js)** files will be declined.

### Dev Tools

To get access to the dev tools, replace the

**Normal Version**: `Grande_Omega\resources\app\desktop\Student\main.js`

**Auto Updater Version**: `Grande_Omega\tmp\main.js`

file with the one found in the root of the repo.
